This application is a prototype for the Wildlife Friendly Traveler web app for the Zoohackaton at the National Zoo in Washington, DC.

The application demonstrates how to allow travelers to look up a country they will be traveling to and find information about wildlife trade products and issues, learn more about the species they will be helping to protect, and become better informed Wildlife Friendly Travelers.
